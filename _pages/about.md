I am a PhD student at Northumbria University, specialising in the intersection of Geopolitics and Financial Markets. My studies focus on understanding how geopolitical events/risks impact financial markets and economic stability.

Outside of university, my other passions include Football, American Football, investing, and the outdoors.
